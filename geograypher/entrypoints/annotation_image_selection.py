            The CRS to interpret the mesh in.
        image_folder (PATH_TYPE, optional):
            Path to the image folder used to generate the project. Only required if
            save_selected_images=True. Defaults to "".
        compute_projection (bool, optional):
            Compute which images project to which faces. Defaults to False.
        compute_minimal_set (bool, optional):
            Compute the minimal set of images required to cover the whole scene. Requires that the
            projections_filename points to a valid projections file. Defaults to False.
        save_selected_images (bool, optional):
            Save the selected images out to selected_images_save_folder. Requires that
            selected_images_mask_filename contain a mask inidicating which images should be
            included. Defaults to False.
        projections_filename (Union[PATH_TYPE, None], optional):
            Where to save or load from the projections to faces. Will have a .npz extension.

            Where to save or load from the selected subset of images as a binary mask. Will have

            Where to save the selected folder of images. Defaults to None.

            Downsample the mesh to this fraction of the original faces. Defaults to 1.
        min_observations_to_be_included (int, optional):
            Ensure that a camera observes all faces that are observed by at least this many cameras.
            Setting to a higher value allows you to avoid including cameras only because they are
            the sole camera to observe a few faces. Defaults to 1.
        vis (bool, optional):
            Show intermediate results. Note that this will cause the process to hang until the
            visualization is closed. Defaults to False.
