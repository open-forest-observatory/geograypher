# Installation

If you only need to use the exisiting functionality of Geograypher and not make changes to the toolkit code or dependencies, follow the `Basic Installation` instructions. 

If you want to do development work, please see `Advanced/Developer Installation`.

Internal collaborators please navigate [here](https://docs.openforestobservatory.org/internal-docs/) for more instructions. 

## Basic Installation
Create and activate a conda environment:

```
conda create -n geograypher -c conda-forge python=3.9 -y
conda activate geograypher
```

Install Geograypher:
```
pip install geograypher
```

## Advanced/Developer Installation
Create and activate a conda environment:

```
conda create -n geograypher -c conda-forge python=3.9 -y
conda activate geograypher
```

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/):

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Now use this to install the majority of dependencies. First cd to the directory containing the `geograypher` repo. Then run:

```
poetry install
```

You may get the following error when running `pyvista` visualization:

### Common errors

#### Poetry hanging
If `poetry install` hangs for a long time with no printouts, you can trying disabling the keyring process. poetry by default is trying to access credentials stored in your system keyring (e.g., for private package repositories) and if that isn't set up it can hang.

```
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
```

Then re-run `poetry install`.

#### libGL error

```
libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to open swrast: <CONDA ENV LOCATION>/bin/../lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found (required by /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libLLVM-15.so.1) (search paths /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri:\$${ORIGIN}/dri:/usr/lib/dri, suffix _dri)
```

If this happens, you can fix it by symlinking to the system version. I don't know why this is required.

```
ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 <CONDA ENV LOCATION>/lib/libstdc++.so.6
```

## Working on Headless Machine
If you are working on a headless machine, such as a remote server, you will need the [XVFB](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) package to provide a virtual frame buffer. This can be installed at the system level using the package manager, for example:
```
sudo apt install xvfb
```
If you do not have root access on your machine, it may not be possible to install xvfb.

## Optional: Install `pytorch3d`
If you are working on a headless machine and are unable to install xvfb, `pytorch3d` can be a viable alternative since installing it does not require admin privileges.

Install the pytorch3d dependencies:

```
conda install pytorch=1.13.0 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath -y
conda install -c bottler nvidiacub -y
conda install pytorch3d -c pytorch3d -y
```

Validate the installation

```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
python -c "import pytorch3d; print(pytorch3d.__version__)"
```
