# Formatting and style
This repository uses `isort` for import management and `black` for general formatting. Both can be installed using `pip` or `conda` and on a Linux system, they can also be installed at the system level using `apt`. For example, using `pip`, you'd simply do
```
pip install isort==5.13.2
pip install black==24.1.0
```
We use the default arguments so the tools can be executed by simply pointing them at all files in the repository. From the root directory of the project, you should execute the following:
```
isort .
black .
```
Note that it's important that `isort` is run first, because it doesn't produce a format that's consistent with `black`. 

If you push changes to main or create a pull request, please be aware that Github Actions will trigger a workflow that runs `isort` and `black` on the code. This will take a few seconds to run and the workflow may automatically push formatting changes to the repository. To ensure your local repository is up to date with the remote repository, wait for a few seconds and pull the latest changes.

# Branch naming
If you are adding a branch to this repository, please use the following convention: `{feature, bugfix, hotfix, release, docs}/{developer initials}/{short-hyphenated-description}`. For example, `docs/DR/add-branch-naming-convention` for this change. For a description of the prefixes, please see [here](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534).

# Docstrings
For documentation, we use the [Google](https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring/blob/HEAD/docs/google.md) format. I personally use [VSCode autoDocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) plugin for templating. Keeping the docstrings up-to-date is essential because we automatically integrate them into our documentation. If the docstrings are outdated, the docstrings shown on the documentation will also outdated. 

# Type hints
Typing hints, as introduced by [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/), are strongly encouraged. This helps provide additional documentation and allows some code editors to make additional autocompletes. 

# Updating Documentation with MkDocs

### Step 1: Create a Conda Environment

First, navigate to the root directory of the project.

Then create a new Conda environment with Python 3.10 and activate it:
```
conda create --name docs-env python=3.10
conda activate docs-env
```

### Step 2: Install MkDocs and Required Plugins
```
pip install 'mkdocstrings[python]'
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-nav-weight
pip install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin
pip install mkdocs-git-committers-plugin
```

### Step 3: Test Locally
```
mkdocs serve
```

After running `mkdocs serve`, MkDocs will provide instructions to view the page on the local host. You should open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the live preview of your documentation.
